<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Did you know an air fryer can do more than just crisp and lend a healthier version of fried food? I decided to cook salmon in mine, and was amazed by the results! Serve with vegetables and rice pilaf if desired.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) salmon fillet</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch dried dill weed</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, season salmon fillet with salt, Greek seasoning, pepper, and dill.</li>
      <li>Line the inner basket of the air fryer with a perforated parchment round. Place salmon onto the parchment, skin side down.</li>
      <li>Air fry salmon until salmon is cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
